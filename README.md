# Computer Vision Text Detection with EasyOCR

EasyOCR is actually a python package that holds PyTorch as a backend handler. EasyOCR like any other OCR(tesseract of Google or any other) detects the text from images but in my reference, while using it I found that it is the most straightforward way to detect text from images also when high end deep learning library(PyTorch) is supporting it in the backend which makes it accuracy more credible. EasyOCR supports 42+ languages for detection purposes. EasyOCR is created by the company named Jaided AI company

In this project we gonna use EasyOCR and OpenCV to detect text from images

```
In order to use it, follow bellow steps:

- 1. git clone https://github.com/HudsonBarroso/computer_vision_Text_Detection.git
- 2. pip install -r requirements.txt
- 3. Load your image containing texts
- 4. Run python code

That is it!
```
